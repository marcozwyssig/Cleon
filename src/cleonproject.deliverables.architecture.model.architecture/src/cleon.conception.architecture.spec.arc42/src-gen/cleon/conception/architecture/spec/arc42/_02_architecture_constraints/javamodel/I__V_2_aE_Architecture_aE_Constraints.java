/**
 * Contents
 * Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design
 * decisions or the development process.
 * 
 * Motivation
 * Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and
 * where they must adhere to constraints.
 * Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.
 * 
 * Form
 * Informal lists, structured by the sub-sections of this section.
 * 
 * Background information
 * In the optimal case constraints are defined by requirements. In any case, at
 * least the architects must be aware of constraints.
 * The influence of constraints is described by [Hofmeister et al] (Software
 * Architecture, A Practical Guide, Addison Wesley 1999)  using the term “global
 * analysis”.
